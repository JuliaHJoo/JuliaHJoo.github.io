abstract: After graduating from the University of Washington, I joined the Seattle Symphony Chorus as a Soprano from 2018-2020. We performed a range of wonderful masterworks with the Seattle Symphony, from Handel's Messiah, Bach Mass in B Minor, and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. 

summary: After graduating undergrad, I sang Soprano in the Seattle Symphony Chorale, an auditioned choir in the Seattle region. We performed all concerts alongside the Seattle Symphony in Benroya Hall.
