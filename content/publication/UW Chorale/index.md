abstract: The Uni­ver­sity of Wash­ing­ton Chorale is an audi­tioned advanced under­grad­u­ate ensem­ble of music and non-music majors from the Seat­tle cam­pus. UW Chorale appears annually as a guest ensem­ble with the Seat­tle Sym­phony, and has sung in joint con­certs with Revalia Male Cham­ber Choir in Esto­nia, and for the Princess of Swe­den. I sang in the Soprano section between 2016-2018. During my time with the UW Chorale, we toured in New York City. This included an opportunity to perform at Carnegie Hall, where I had a solo for the piece 'River' by Joan Szymko. We performed masterworks such as Verdi's Requiem and were prominently featured in the Holiday POPS concerts with the Seattle Symphony every December. This started my love of performing in grand venues like Benaroya Hall in Seattle and performing with incredible orchestras like the Seattle Symphony!

summary: I sang Soprano in the UW Chorale, an auditioned advanced undergraduate choir. We toured in NYC in 2018, which I had the chance to perform a solo at Carnegie Hall.
