abstract: *Purpose* To compare diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression in patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) to those on SGLT-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2I) given prior reports of paradoxical “early worsening” of DR associated with GLP-1RA. <br> <br> *Methods* Patients seen at a tertiary referral center on GLP-1RA or SGLT-2I from 2012 to 2023 were included. A multivariable logistic regression model evaluated the odds of DR worsening, defined by ICD-10 code changes, between the drugs.  <br> <br> *Results* Among 1,191 patients on GLP-1RA and SGLT-2I, the only difference in baseline characteristics, including age, HbA1C, and DR severity, was higher BMI in GLP-1RA users (37kg/m2 vs 34 kg/m2, p<0.001). There was no difference in DR worsening between GLP-1RA vs SGLT-2I users (OR=1.50, 95% CI 0.81-2.91, p=0.2). The most frequent events were development of any DR from baseline no DR (37% of worsening events), vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment development from baseline proliferative DR (PDR) (22%), and progression to PDR (21%). No difference between the drugs was observed in these events (p>0.05).  <br> <br> *Conclusion* In our study, DR worsening was not associated with GLP-1RA compared to SGLT-2I. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We found no association between GLP-1RA and DR in our single-center study.
