abstract: I've also enjoyed exploring music and singing outside of choirs. I had the chance to perform the national anthem for the Seattle Reign FC soccer team, which was one of my life highlights so far! I also performed with my best friend at my college Biochemistry graduation ceremony, sang for the Gates family at a UW research event, and helped with creating harmonic arrangements for Doc Opera, an annual fundraiser at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. These photos can be seen in the Gallery.

summary: My other singing highlights include performing the national anthem for Seattle Reign FC, as well as performing with friends at other fun events!
