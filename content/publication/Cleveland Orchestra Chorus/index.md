abstract: Upon starting medical school in Cleveland, one of my major personal goals was to be able to sing with the Cleveland Orchestra, one of the top orchestral institutions in the world! However, this was also at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and the Orchestra and Chorus, reasonably so, had temporarily shut down. As cases started to fall toward the end of 2021, however, the Orchestra and Chorus gradually reopened with masking and COVID-19 precautions. After years of quarantining apart from one another without the option to enjoy live music together as a community, it was a gratifying feeling to be a part of the first performances in the re-emergence of music performances in the dwindling of the pandemic.

summary: During medical school, I began to sing with the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus. Our performances with the Cleveland Orchestra included the first in the re-emergence after the pandemic.
